The application is a simple banking application. User can log into their account and see their accounts listed with how much money each account has. User can also move money from one account to another, or transfer money to other users. This is done by selecting one of users’ own accounts and then choosing the receiving account. All accounts in the database are listed. There is also sign-up option for new users.
